# month-boundary-knn
A time series algorithm for monthly-to-daily multisite streamflow disaggregation that preserves streamflow continuity at simulated month boundaries.

This code is referenced in the article "A Monthly-to-Daily KNN Multisite Streamflow
Disaggregation Procedure to Maintain Daily Flow Continuity at Month-Boundaries" (submitted to Water Resources Research)

To reproduce the results in the article, run the script "RUNME_script_MBKNN_Nowak_Compare.m" in Matlab. No additional Matlab toolboxes are required.
